## :b: Descriptions

**Rust (R):** The language that spends more time ensuring you can't cause a memory error than it does actually running your code.
**Go (4):** A simple, boring language that gets stuff done because it has no time for your fancy abstractions.
**ADA (D):** The language where writing "Hello World" feels like filing a permit request with the Department of Bureaucracy.
**LLVM (L):** The universal translator that turns your fancy code into machine mumbles so you don't have to.
**ASM (A):** You tell the computer exactly what to do, and it still finds a way to do it wrong.

**Haskell (3):** Where your code is so mathematically pure it has a PhD, but it can't print "Hello World" without a monadic incantation.
**Clojure (6):** A Lisp that decided to wear the JVM's clothes and become incredibly practical and cool.
**Elm (5):** The friendly functional language that holds your hand so tightly you can't ever make a runtime error.
**:one: [Scala](1.Scala):** The language that gives you so many powerful tools you'll inevitably build an incomprehensible abstract nightmare.

**:two: [Python](2.Python):** The friendly, readable language that lets you do anything, as long you do it with the proper indentation.
**PHP (P):** The duct-taped-together language that powered the old web and refuses to die, much to everyone's amazement.
**TypeScript (7):** JavaScript wearing a business suit and carrying a clipboard to keep its chaotic sibling in check.

**Julia (8):** The speed demon of scientific computing that's tired of you asking if it's just for data science.
**JVM (J):** The rock-solid party mansion where languages like Scala and Clojure come to hang out and take out their own garbage.

*Disclaimer: This is all in good fun. Every language is brilliant and has its rightful place.*
